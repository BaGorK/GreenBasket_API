- Can manage users, vendors, products, orders, payouts, platform settings, and content.

### 2. **VENDOR**

- Represents a store or seller on the platform.
- Can manage their own products, orders, shipping, payouts, reviews, and store settings.
- Cannot access or modify other vendors' data or platform-wide settings.

### 3. **CUSTOMER**

- Regular user who browses and purchases products.
- Can manage their own orders, account, addresses, reviews, and wishlists.

**Optional / Advanced Roles** (for future scalability):

- **SUPPORT** or **MODERATOR**: Limited admin rights for handling disputes, customer support, or moderation.
  - Respond to user messages in the chat system (but not act as an admin in all cases).
  - Review and approve/decline user verification requests.
  - Access limited admin tools (view/edit users, but not manage vendors or platform settings).

**In your schema, you already have these as the `UserRole` enum:**

```prisma
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
  VENDOR
  SUPPORT
  STAFF
  DELIVERY
}
```

This set is perfect for a standard e-commerce marketplace.  
You can safely start with these, and add more specialized roles later as your business grows!
